# ✅ CI/CD Module 3: Train a Model and Log Results with CI

📁 **Folder:** `03_train_model_with_action/`  
🔧 **Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/03-trigger-optuna-run.yml`  
🎯 **Goal:** Automatically run a model training script and log results to a file every time I push.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

1. How to run a `.py` file instead of a `.ipynb` notebook
2. how to save model's output
3. how to keep things reproducable with conda + pip
4. how this fits into a later multi-step pipeline

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters
This is a simulation of real-life ML tasks like

1. Training on new data
2. Logging metrics
3. Saving artifacts like plots, models, reports

This is where`dev` meets `ops`! 😂
